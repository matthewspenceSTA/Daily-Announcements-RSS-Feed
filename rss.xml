The team played with determination and heart, finishing third in their round robin and battling hard all the way through playoffs. After an intense bronze medal match, they ended the day with a respectable fourth place finish out of 10 teams! Your coach is very proud of the incredible sportsmanship, teamwork, and positive energy you showed throughout the day. You represented STA with pride, spirit, and class.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e1429afef7a7b30b8f0e45e3726dcbb7210a66f2eb52f71e24be665118e7f774</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:46:16 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
