If you have any questions about your choices, please stop by Guidance during lunch. Attention all students: There will be a student council meeting today at lunch in Room 214. New members are always welcome—come share your ideas and get involved! Athletics update: The senior boys’ basketball team has a home game tonight at 3:30 p.m. Come out and support the team. Go Ravens! Community involvement reminder: Students still working on their 40 volunteer hours are encouraged to check the school website for approved opportunities or speak with a Guidance Counsellor for help getting started. Friendly reminder: Please make sure you are placing garbage and recycling in the correct bins throughout the school. Let’s all do our part to keep our school clean and welcoming.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ee72d84f5c7e67321644c96238448fa29d5be17a4b90325b27786c17d497bd3f</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:35:28 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
